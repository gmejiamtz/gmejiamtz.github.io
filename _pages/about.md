I am current computer engineering student focusing on hardware design and systems programming.
My work so far has been on EDA design, mainly facilitaing memory design and verification and place and route
of FPGAs and ASICs. Currently I am working under Professor [Dustin Richmond](https://www.dustinrichmond.com) and Professor [Jason Eshraghian](https://www.jasoneshraghian.com) on modeling DRAM cell discharge to model a spiking neural net. For Spring 2025, I am taking CSE 222B - System on a Chip Design, and I am the teaching assistant for CSE 100 - Logic Design.
