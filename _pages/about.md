I am current computer engineer focusing on hardware design and systems programming.
My work so far has been on EDA design, mainly facilitaing memory design and verification and place and route
of FPGAs and ASICs. I worked Professor [Dustin Richmond](https://www.dustinrichmond.com) and Professor [Jason Eshraghian](https://www.jasoneshraghian.com) on modeling DRAM cell discharge to model a spiking neural net. The project and results can be read [here](https://gmejiamtz.github.io/assets/pdf/dram_discharge.pdf). Feel free to explore the `projects` tab for various projects I have completed.
