I am a founder hardware engineer at [Type 1 Compute](https://www.type1compute.com/), implementing custom spiking neural network models on FPGAs.
My Bachelor's and Master's are from the University of California, Santa Cruz where I worked with Professor [Dustin Richmond](https://www.dustinrichmond.com) and Professor [Jason Eshraghian](https://www.jasoneshraghian.com) on modeling DRAM cell discharge to model a spiking neural net. The project and results can be read [here](https://gmejiamtz.github.io/assets/pdf/dram_discharge.pdf). Feel free to explore the `projects` tab for various projects I have completed.
